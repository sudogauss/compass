# COMPASS LIBRARY

Compass Library consists of multiple ***space*** representations with well defined conversion rules. ***Space***, whether it is 2D or 3D space, can be represented in multiple ways. See ***space*** folder
for more information. Compass also contains **path-finding** and **obstacle-avoidance** algorithms combined in ***algorithms*** folder. Each **algorithm** is implemented on at least one space representation.
Compass also contains some utils and tools.
